### 08:34 - Set up basic Vite/React/Vitest/TypeScript UI module [opencode/kimi-k2.5-free]

**User Prompt:**
setup a basic vite/react/vitest/typescript ui module in the "ui/" folder

**Issues Encountered:**
- SVG file imports needed TypeScript declarations to avoid "Cannot find module" errors
- Vitest configuration conflict with Vite's defineConfig - the `test` property wasn't recognized when importing from 'vite'
- Version mismatch between @vitejs/plugin-react (using Vite 6) and vitest (using Vite 5) caused type incompatibility
- Prettier formatting check failed initially on several files

**Decisions Made:**
- Created separate vite.config.ts (for Vite) and vitest.config.ts (for Vitest) to avoid type conflicts
- Created src/types/assets.d.ts for SVG module declarations
- Used happy-dom as test environment for faster, lighter testing compared to jsdom
- Included immer as a dependency per project AGENTS.md requirements
- Set up @testing-library/jest-dom for DOM assertions

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- AGENTS.md for project conventions (Jestor store, immer, documentation strategy)
- Vitest documentation for configuration options
- Vite documentation for React plugin setup

**Assumptions Made:**
- Using React 18 (stable) rather than React 19 (latest but newer)
- Using Vitest 2.x (compatible with current ecosystem)
- Using TypeScript 5.6 (specified in tsconfig)
- Tests should be colocated with source files as per AGENTS.md

**Other Notes:**
- All checks pass: TypeScript compilation, Prettier formatting, and tests
- Production build works correctly
- Test command runs in watch mode by default, `check` command runs tests once
- Created basic App component with counter functionality as a starting point
